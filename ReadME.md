# AI Ant Colony

Welcome to the AI Ant Colony project! This project aims to simulate the behavior of an ant colony using artificial intelligence techniques. By leveraging AI algorithms, we can create a realistic and dynamic ant colony environment.

## Features

- **Ant Behavior Simulation**: The project simulates the behavior of individual ants, including foraging, communication, and nest building. Each ant has its own set of rules and behaviors that contribute to the overall functioning of the colony.

- **AI Algorithms**: We utilize various AI algorithms, such as swarm intelligence and reinforcement learning, to model the collective behavior of the ant colony. These algorithms enable the ants to adapt and optimize their actions based on environmental factors and interactions with other ants.

- **Interactive Visualization**: The simulation provides an interactive visualization of the ant colony, allowing you to observe and analyze the ants' actions in real-time. You can track the movement of individual ants, monitor the distribution of pheromones, and visualize the construction of ant nests.

- **Customizable Parameters**: You can easily customize the parameters of the simulation, such as the number of ants, pheromone levels, and environmental factors, to study different scenarios. This flexibility allows you to explore the impact of various factors on the behavior and efficiency of the ant colony.

## Getting Started

To get started with the AI Ant Colony project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-ant-colony.git`. This will create a local copy of the project on your machine.

2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`. This will install all the necessary libraries and packages needed to run the simulation.

3. Run the simulation: `python main.py`. This command will start the simulation and display the interactive visualization of the ant colony. You can observe the ants' behavior and explore different scenarios by adjusting the customizable parameters.
